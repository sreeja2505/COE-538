# COE-538 PROJECT

The following code for the Project is based on EEBOT Robot which works on the Assembly language. 

Theeebotconsists of a 3-board sandwich. From top to bottom, the layers are:
- A microprocessor development system.
- The robot mainframe.
- The sensor board.

There are two versions of aneebot. The one presented in figure 1 uses a 68HC11 microprocessor developmentsystem (the MPP Board, unmodified). The second version of aneebot(currently in use) is built on an HCS12 microcontroller.
